# Ensemble Learning-Based Mental Health Assessment-Model
This project builds a machine-learning-based diagnostic system that predicts mental health conditions—including Normal, Depression, Bipolar Type-1, and Bipolar Type-2.
We use ensemble learning techniques (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest) combined with Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP to enhance accuracy, interpretability, and clinical usefulness.

A custom Flask web application is provided for real-time predictions, visualization, and confidence scoring.
