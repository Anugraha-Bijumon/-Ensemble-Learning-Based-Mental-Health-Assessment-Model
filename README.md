# -Ensemble-Learning-Based-Mental-Health-Assessment-Model
Developed a predictive model using survey inputs (1–10 scale) to classify users into Bipolar I/II, Depression, or Normal using Bagging,  Boosting, and Random Forest.

# Overview

This project builds a machine-learning-based diagnostic system that predicts mental health conditions—including Normal, Depression, Bipolar Type-1, and Bipolar Type-2.
We use ensemble learning techniques (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest) combined with Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP to enhance accuracy, interpretability, and clinical usefulness.

A custom Flask web application is provided for real-time predictions, visualization, and confidence scoring.
